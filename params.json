{"name":"Zend-server-php-build-pack","tagline":"Early Preview - Zend Server PHP build-pack for cloud foundry","body":"# Overview\r\n\r\nThis is a release preview of a build pack provides Zend Server on Cloud Foundry. Current version is 6.1. In the future the web server and Zend Server binaries will be probably be moved to the stack. This will save space for each container and make pushes and restart almost instant. For the time being they are included in the build pack for portability and ease of installation. Use this build pack at your own risk.\r\n\r\n## Buildpack components\r\n\r\n* Zend Server 6.1 Enterprise edition.\r\n* Zend Server 6.1 configuration files\r\n* PHP 5.4\r\n* Nginx web server\r\n\r\n\r\n# Installation\r\n## Requirements\r\n### Public cloudfoundry.com environment\r\n* An account in cloudfoundry.com with at least 512M available RAM.\r\n\r\n### Local cloud foundry environment\r\n* Working cloud foundry v2 environment with dea_ng and gorouter\r\n* The lucid64 cloud foundry stack should be installed and enabled - check settings in /vagrant/dea_ng/config/dea.yml\r\n* xz compression utility - it's installed automatically by vagrant if you follow the guide below\r\n\r\nThe buildpack is tested against the public cloudfoundry.com environment and a local  system generated by the vagrant installer: http://blog.cloudfoundry.com/2013/06/27/installing-cloud-foundry-on-vagrant/\r\n\r\n## Instructions\r\nYou can use the buildpack by specifying it at the command line without installaing it. If you have a slow internet connection you can speed up deployment by cloning the git repo into the buildpack directory on your dea_ng node using the command:\r\n`git clone https://github.com/davidl-zend/zend-server-php-build-pack`\r\n\r\nAlternatively you can clone the repo into a webserver in your environment and specify the buildpack to the cf client:\r\nf.e  cf push --buildpack=http://url-to-cloned-repo or https://github.com/davidl-zend/zend-server-php-build-pack  (you can save this value in the app's manifest.yml).\r\n\r\n# Usage\r\n1. Create a folder on your workstation and \"cd\" into it.\r\n2. Create an empty file named \"zend_server_php_app\" (if you don't do this then you'll have to manually specify which buildpack to use for the app).\r\n3. Issue the \"cf push --buildpack=https://github.com/davidl-zend/zend-server-php-build-pack \" command (choose to save your manifest when asked to by the cf client).\r\n4. Edit the \"manifest.yml\" that was generated by step 3 - add the \"env\" section and set the values to be used for the Zend Server GUI password.\r\n\r\n```\r\n---\r\nenv:\r\n  ZS_ACCEPT_EULA: 'TRUE'\r\n  ZS_ADMIN_PASSWORD: '1234'\r\napplications:\r\n- name: dave2\r\n  instances: 1\r\n  memory: 512M\r\n  host: dave2\r\n  domain: vcap.me\r\n  path: .\r\n  buildpack: https://github.com/davidl-zend/zend-server-php-build-pack\r\n```\r\n\r\n5. wait for the app to start.\r\n6. Once the app is started you can access the Zend Server GUI at http://url-to-your-app/ZendServer, For example : http://dave2.vcap.me/ZendServer . If you forgot to perform step 4 then the password for the GUI will be \"changeme\". To change it perform step 4 and issue the command \"cf push --reset\"\r\n7. Enter a user name and password to use to authenticate with the GUI.\r\n8. If you saved your manifest then you can push future updates to the app by specifiying the command \"cf push\" (no need to respecify the buildpack since the value is saved in your manifest.yml).\r\n\r\n## Known issues\r\n* Deployment of applications (zpk packages) from the Zend Server GUI might fail. A workaround is to patch the lucid64 stack on your dea_ng node with the script below.\r\n\r\n```\r\n#TODO: This should really be in the script that creates the rootfs\r\n#Point ROOTFS to the directory that really holds the warden rootfs (the template used for creating the containers that run the droplets)\r\nROOTFS=/var/warden/rootfs\r\nsudo mkdir -p $ROOTFS/usr/share/nginx\r\nsudo ln -s -f /app/www $ROOTFS/usr/share/nginx/html \r\n```\r\n* Code tracing does not yet work in this version.\r\n* Scaling is not yet supported: the php app does scale but Zend Server settings are not yet propagated to all servers in the cluster.\r\n* In a multi-instance environment you might be occasionally asked to re-login to the Zend Server GUI.\r\n* You can change settings using the gui and apply them - but they won't survive application pushes and restarts.\r\n* Application generated data is not persistent (this is a limitation of Cloud Foundry) unless saved to a third party storage provider (like S3).\r\n* Mysql is not used automatically - If you require MySQL then you'll have to setup your own server and configure your app to use it.\r\n* Each container has their own full copy of Zend Server at the moment so it consumes about 300MB.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
